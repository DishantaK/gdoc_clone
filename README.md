# gdoc_clone
Clone for Google Docs crafted with Node, Express, Mongodb, Jquery and a splash of good ole' fashioned Vanilla JavaSCript.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples.. i.e folder structure. Why public vs. gitpages etc. 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Example Local
```

```
Heroku/public
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system


### And coding style tests

This app uses dynamic rendering to display the documents to the page. This is a one page app, so any rendered element will be in the separate stylesheet titled doc.css

```
Styling Home UI
```

```
Styling Docs Page
```
